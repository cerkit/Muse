A C# Program for creating Algorithmic Compositions

## Getting Started

To get started developing MUSE, you will need to ensure that you have .[NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) on your computer as well as the [.NET 4.8 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48). The legacy .NET Framework is required to use the [Sanford C# MIDI Music Toolkit](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6228/C-MIDI-Toolkit).
